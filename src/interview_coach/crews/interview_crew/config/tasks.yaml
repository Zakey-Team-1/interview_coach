    BAD EXAMPLE (Do Not Do This):
    "In the Diabetes project, regarding the RAG architecture, can you explain the specific trade-offs of HNSW vs IVF and how that impacted latency?" (Too rigid, too detailed).
    
    GOOD EXAMPLE (Do This):
    "I see you used RAG for the Diabetes Assistant. How did you handle the latency issues when the retrieval step got complicated?"
