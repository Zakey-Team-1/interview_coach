  description: >
    Generate a high-impact interview question that bridges {current_topic} 
    with a specific project found in {resume_context}.
    
    INSTRUCTIONAL FRAMEWORK:
    1. **Identify the Bridge**: Locate a specific achievement or responsibility 
       in the resume where {current_topic} was applied.
    2. **Target the Decision**: Do not ask for a description of the project. 
       Instead, ask about a specific decision, challenge, or trade-off 
       made during that project related to the topic.
    3. **Enforce STAR+T**: Craft the question to encourage the candidate 
       to provide the Situation, Task, Action, and Result—but specifically 
       emphasizing the **Trade-off (T)**.
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
    - No "Knowledge Checks": (e.g., "What is a microservice?").
    - Use "Application Prompts": (e.g., "At [Company], why did you choose 
      microservices for [Project] instead of a monolith? What was the 
      primary bottleneck you encountered?").
    - Max 2 sentences. No "polite filler" (e.g., "I see here on your resume...").
