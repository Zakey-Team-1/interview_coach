create_interview_roadmap:
  description: >
    Review the provided {job_description}.
    
    Output a list of 5 conversational themes we need to cover in the interview.
    Each theme should be broad enough to allow for a conversation, but specific enough to be relevant.
    
    Do NOT include "signals" or "competencies." Just the theme and a brief note on why it matters.

  expected_output: >
    A simple JSON list of themes.
    Example:
    [
      "RAG Pipeline Optimization (Critical for our search feature)",
      "Python Async handling (Needed for the high-traffic API)",
      "Stakeholder Management (We work with non-technical PMs)"
    ]
