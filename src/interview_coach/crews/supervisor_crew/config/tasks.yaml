    Analyze the Job Description and historical performance data to create a 
    lean, high-signal interview roadmap.
    
    1. **Identify the Pivot Points**: In {job_description}, find 5-7 areas where 
       technical choice or behavioral judgment is most critical (e.g., not just 
       "JavaScript," but "State Management Complexity").
    2. **Define the Signal**: For each area, determine what a "Senior" level 
       answer looks like versus a "Junior" level answer.
    3. **Historical Calibration**: Review performance data to see if any 
       topics need deeper "Stress Testing" due to common team weaknesses.
